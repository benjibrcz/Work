The codes here correspond to simulations of gravitational collapse of a quantum field, which was the topic of my PhD.
The simulations are explained in detail in my PhD thesis available at: https://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/77527/

There are five simulations that correspond to a chapter in my thesis:

semiclassical_collapse_Alcubierre.c - Chapter 2

semiclassical_collapse_Galerkin.c   - Chapter 3

semiclassical_collapse_Rinne.c      - Chapter 4

semiclassical_collapse_Stewart.c    - Chapter 5

semiclassical_collapse_Ori.c        - Chapter 6

In addition, the "nb" files are Mathematica notebooks where I calculated the differential equations needed for the simulations. 

Any questions about these simulations, feel free to email me at benji.berczi@gmail.com.
